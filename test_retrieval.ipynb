      "1. **Bachelor of Science in Computer Science**: Computer Science (CS) is a rapidly changing field. The ideas and research results emanating from it are swiftly transformed into practice. Therefore, the Bachelor of Science program in computer science offers not only technical instruction on the frontier of new developments but also provides students with a broad education that covers the core areas of computer science. This ensures a foundation for continued and sustainable career growth in the computing profession for our students. This curriculum in Computer Science is deliberately oriented towards giving the students education in the broad area of computer science from which the student can acquire the necessary skills and experience needed to solve real-world practical problems. In addition, students are given the freedom to create their own computer science study program in either breadth or depth so as to enable them to pursue their strength and interests depending upon their future career plans.
